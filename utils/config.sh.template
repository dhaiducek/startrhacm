# Copy this template and rename it to config.sh in the same /utils directory
# It was implemented as a bash script in case you'd like to use your own logic or variables to further customize the variable content
# All variables below EXCEPT for the Git paths are optional--Lifeguard will prompt you for anything not provided
# Setting CLUSTERCLAIM_END_TIME is highly recommended--it will implement custom logic in this script to delete the cluster at the given time

# Path to Git directories
export LIFEGUARD_PATH="" # Path to local Lifeguard repo
export RHACM_DEPLOY_PATH="" # Path to local Deploy repo
export RHACM_PIPELINE_PATH="" # Path to local Pipeline repo

# Paths for allowable ingress auth redirects from localhost (for development) -- defaults to none if not provided; used in template "https://localhost:3000/multicloud" + ${PATH} + "auth/callback"
# For example: export AUTH_REDIRECT_PATHS=("/" "/policies/" "/header/" "/topology/" "/applications/" "/clusters/" "/overview/" "/bare-metal-assets/" "/search/")
export AUTH_REDIRECT_PATHS=()

# ClusterClaim exports
export CLUSTERPOOL_TARGET_NAMESPACE="" # Your namespace on the collective cluster
export CLUSTERPOOL_NAME="" # Name of the ClusterPool to use
export CLUSTERPOOL_RESIZE="" # Set to "true" to allow resizing of the pool if all clusters have been claimed (CLUSTERPOOL_TARGET_NAMESPACE and CLUSTERPOOL_NAME must both be specified for this to work)
export CLUSTERPOOL_MAX_CLUSTERS="" # Maximum clusters to allow in the ClusterPool if CLUSTERPOOL_RESIZE is enabled)
export CLUSTERCLAIM_NAME="" # Name of the clusterclaim to create
export CLUSTERCLAIM_GROUP_NAME="" # RBAC group in cluster (also used for labeling--should match GitHub team)
export CLUSTERCLAIM_END_TIME="" # Integer hour in 24h clock at which to expire the cluster
export CLUSTERCLAIM_LIFETIME="" # If CLUSTERCLAIM_END_TIME is not set, you can also set a lifetime here of the format 1h2m3s, omitting units as desired (or set it to "false" for no lifetime)

# RHACM configuration - defaults to latest available edge snapshot
export RHACM_BRANCH="" # Override branch -- must be a two-part version like "1.2". This will get the latest version of the branch specified.
export RHACM_VERSION="" # Override version -- must be three-part version like "1.2.3"
export PIPELINE_PHASE="" # Override release phase -- defaults to edge (usually either edge or stable are available to install from quay--not integration)
export RHACM_SNAPSHOT="" # Override the snapshot entirely -- should match (or omit) other RHACM version exports to prevent query errors
export DOWNSTREAM="" # Deploy a downstream release -- set to "true" (defaults to upstream if not set). DEPLOY_DOWNSTREAM can be used alongside RHACM_VERSION and RHACM_BRANCH to fiter for versions.
